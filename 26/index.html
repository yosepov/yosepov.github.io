 Recent research shows that big data is the new frontier for innovation and productivity, with transparent information and utilizable at much higher levels. Companies will more and more need to access and integrate huge amounts of information from multiple data sources. Big Data analytics in the logistics industry can be used to optimize routing, for example, with major operational improvements possible regarding last-mile deliveries. This specific challenge in last-mile logistics can be tricky. It is often the most expensive component for shipping companies that have to navigate in urban areas, with traffic congestion and limited space, in order to reach a destination on time. Shippers expect transparency and supply chain visibility is critical. If a shipment is late, carriers want to know about it as soon as possible to prevent serious complications in the supply chain. On the other hand, efficient deliveries carried out on time will be a merit for the carrier while the shipper will feel confident and customer satisfaction will increase. As mentioned, route optimization depends on quick data analysis, while keeping in mind that weather conditions could change, highway and roads could close, and the number of vehicles on the roads could increase, thereby changing the scheduled time frame. Based on the pace of hybrid vehicle development in the world, it seems to be the most promising idea for the next generation of trucks. This next period will be a middle step in the move towards electricity as the main fuel source. The EU, the USA and Japan already are improving efficiency through engine downsizing. Low Emissions Zones (LEZ) are becoming more popular in cities throughout the developed world. This is a defined area where access is restricted to improve air quality. Polluting trucks are not allowed to enter, therefore this is an additional incentive for logistics companies to use more dual-fuel engines to ensure that regular cargo deliveries will not be interrupted. After we see hybrid trucks on the market we will be able to think about how to make the full electric system more efficient. The solution is to find a way of charging the battery during the trip, using already existing technologies such as solar panels or wireless roads that charge the vehicle while driving. Our goal for the moment is to create optimization by using a variety of digital technologies to manage efficiently heavy duty vehicle fleets costs and has led to a reduction of thousands of tons of CO2 emissions.. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Business Intelligence (BI) AI provides the power to analyze huge amounts of data, allowing logistics companies to utilize data daily. One of the key goals of the logistics industry is to automate time- consuming activities, to increase efficiency and reduce transportation costs. AI provides a set of algorithms that offers complex outputs and decisions based upon incoming data. The combination of the fields will give us, among other things, the business intelligence (BI) that uses techniques such as data mining in order to improve business processes. Machine Learning – the computer ’ s ability to learn and draw conclusions based on a database and we enjoy automatic service (A-Z) at the click of a button. Big data has changed warehouse operations considerably. By applying computer vision taking inventory has become automatic and of course much more productive. In the case of the autonomous vehicle, it still will take some time before we find such a mode of transportation on roads, without human supervision. Hanan Friedman Founder and President However, autonomous vehicles are already used to transport goods within warehouse areas, airports and harbors. The fast-changing world of technology brings us a new way of life. It has changed our way of thinking. We live our lives digitally in communicating with other people, -no matter if it is with our family, our friends, or at work. Should we sometimes remind ourselves that messaging started with pigeon post over 2000 years ago? 26
