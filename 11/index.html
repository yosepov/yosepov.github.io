 In recent years, the area of warehouse robotics has gained prominence in circles of supply chains, distribution centers, and warehouse management. It plays a significant role in warehouse automation with technologies that increase productivity. The warehouse is in the center of manufacturing and supply chain operations, as it provides the storage and holds responsibility for the safekeeping of goods. Warehouse robotics uses automated systems for the handling, picking, sorting, and replenishment of products with precision. This innovation can guarantee high levels of accuracy in order fulfillment and warehousing operations, for inventory management. What are the benefits of automated warehouses? The increase of automation worldwide is leading to a decrease in the need for human labor and many people are feeling this shift. The idea behind automated warehouses is to have machines operate the heavy weight tasks, while humans remain in supervisory positions. Warehouse operators will be able to handle much larger volumes of goods per day. Automated warehouse robots can increase accuracy and accelerate repetitive processes when collaborating with human employees. The system can also lead to reduced expenses connected with human labor, such as sick leave days. Safety in the workplace cannot be overlooked. Robots can take the most stressful and dangerous aspects of operations, for example, retrieving inventory from heights and lifting heavy machinery. This assistance reduces physical accidents and can ease the mental pressure on human workers. Lessening this emotional stress can lead to a boost in employee productivity and creating a healthier work environment. Using appropriate robots in the warehouse will lead to reducing human error. Employees can focus more on complex tasks and save time that otherwise would be wasted on going back and forth from different 11 Automation opens up great opportunities for logistics businesses. What will be our next step in the world of robotics?
