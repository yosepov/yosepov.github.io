 extremely popular among start-ups and even among more established companies. For those companies trying to create an online freight marketplace, a BID system (bidding price, like an auction) would offer the client the opportunity to compare and find the best match for the price. This type of coordination using live updates and documentation can greatly improve freight management. Digitalization is a big game-changer for the new generation of TMS. With pre- installed features for all cargo documentation, the tax process can proceed faster and smoother. This saves much time and delay; for example, at a port when a truck is forced to wait for hours before moving on. Today cargo companies prefer to have trucks with built-in Telematics in their fleets. Manufacturers have made a new business model in which they not only provide the device, they also provide the service, which contributes to a more profitable business. Machine learning can be applied to predict the need for vehicle maintenance. Methods for predictive maintenance combine on-board data and off-board database sources, which analyze the data for deviations (based on vehicle usage statistics and maintenance records). Business Intelligence (BI) resources make it possible to create value from big data. Some examples of these technologies include dashboards, data warehouses, data analysis through graphs and more. For example, BI tools can improve logistics management by providing a view of the entire supply chain, and offer an analysis of where delays are most likely to occur. The biggest challenge today for TMS is visibility. The system streamlines the entire supply chain process, with automated communication between suppliers, customers, and service providers. TMS and Telematics, and even BID, are not enough for today ’ s cargo companies; there is a lot of data but it is not automatically analyzed. Below you can get an idea of the high percentage of trucks traveling empty on roads throughout the world, leading to extreme inefficiency: OECD North America commercial vehicle fleet The goal of the transportation and logistics industry is to connect and integrate data from all sources into one platform. AI (Artificial Intelligence), BI and Machine Learning can provide a detailed analysis of all factors and at the end of the day offer excellence to the fleet manager. He will be able to make better decisions for increased efficiency and sustainability. Here at Trucknet, we call this an All- in-One solution and we are applying our resources to assimilate these components into one platform to make it easier for logistics and transportation companies. Some areas in which this can be seen include: *Supply chain efficiency around the world (e.g. Moovit - simplifies urban mobility) *The collective intelligence factor - crowd wisdom (e.g. Waze) *Quick and easy to use global cargo marketplace (e.g. Booking). My point of view is that the solution is ALL-IN-ONE . This is my opinion and I stand by it. 16
