 30 What are the actions we can take? We must begin to regard the economic co-benefits of lowering carbon emissions and company profit. Our goal is to put a company ’ s profit along the same line with environmental needs. The logistics industry faces a challenge however, at the same time, also an excellent opportunity. The business strategy of a company must be focused not only on finding low- cost solutions when it chooses the supplier for its services. In the world today, we notice a lot of leading companies choosing environmentally sound solutions, such as reducing deadhead mileage. Then, we moved to the idea of BI (Business Intelligence), a technology- driven process for analyzing data from a company ’ s activities. Better information is provided that helps executives, managers and other corporate end-users make informed business decisions. Remember the fleet manager? His work is inefficient because nobody provided him with the tools he needs. For the manager of the fleet there is technology chaos on the table: TMS, Telematics, GPS and systems for route optimization. They are not connected. To avoid jumping from system to system requires a one-stop shop. One of the tools the fleet manager needs for a one-stop shop solution is an emission calculations device including an online dashboard . The system supposed should be connected to all available data in order to calculate automatically optimized routes according to traffic, road situation, distance in a lifetime for the entire run. The search will bring a better solution for the smartest way for providing cargo delivery. The system will support the fleet manager and become his best partner of the day. This is the time to change the culture of the industry of transportation and logistics and to recognize the importance of more sustainable behavior. Technology can help us find a better way to transport goods by improving fleet operations and lowering carbon footprints. The innovative option for calculating carbon emissions, based on the truck ’ s specifications such as the year of manufacture, the weight of loads, fuel consumption and more, will greatly improve efficiency through route optimization. Save emissions, save energy, save money, Make more profit.
