 A new generation of last-mile service 23 Oct 2020 Last mile logistics is the final step of a delivery process from the distribution hub to the end customer. In a supply chain, cargo or parcels can be delivered to a central hub through various modes of transport, such as planes, ships, trains and trucks. The typical final destination of a product ’ s journey is to a private residence or storage in a large cargo warehouse. This issue of the “ last mile ” has become a high priority for companies mainly because of the high costs involved in moving goods.

If no one is home to receive a package they offer a few options including the use of pick-up locations. They aim to earn clients ’ trust, reduce delays and save money for the company. In the past few years, Amazon introduced a system of small drones in big cities that provides fast delivery within 30 minutes for parcels (within a 20km radius) weighing up to 2.3 kg. A challenge for large delivery companies and their expanded networks is how to focus on and optimize the last-mile route, for reducing logistics costs and improving efficiency. TMS (Transport Management System) software is used to create better routes and can identify additional risk, cargo emissions, traffic conditions, fuel costs and even labor costs.
