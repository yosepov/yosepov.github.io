 What are the main functions of TMS? No matter what the size of a logistics company, we find that its main task is to increase efficiency and profitability for clients. The main function of a TMS Is to manage route schedules and delivery operations. The importance of telematics in transport systems cannot be overlooked. Efficient transportation management and licensing result in reduced vehicle wear and tear and increased vehicle uptime (ensuring the vehicle is always ready to perform). Analyzing engine status and driving behavior can reduce fuel costs by 10% on average, often equating to a payback of millions. Freight transport operations are a major source of CO2 emissions, while efficient management and performance can reduce the carbon footprint and promote more sustainable logistics activities. It should be noted that a TMS does not analyze the data that is conveyed to the fleet manager. What are the telematics information resources? For transport fleets operating in competitive markets, even the smallest amount of time and resources become critical issues in determining success. It ’ s here that a vehicle tracking device alone is not enough. The telematics system uses a few sources of information. Actively managing your fleet ’ s fuel consumption can save you money, increase productivity, and even improve safety. One way to reduce the amount of fuel used is by improving poor driving behavior. It has been proven time and again that fuel is consumed unnecessarily when drivers speed, idle their vehicles, brake and/or accelerate harshly. These behaviors not only waste fuel but may also cause excess vehicle wear and tear, which leads to the need for more frequent fleet maintenance. Studies show that a fleet management tracking device does an excellent job of monitoring the location and activities of a vehicle. Also, reports published on fleet management software show that it provides the best means to mitigate risks, such as dangerous driving behavior, and to identify who may need professional driver training. A carbon footprint calculator allows us to measure a truck ’ s CO2 emissions. Certain heavy vehicle fleets are already required to calculate and report GHG emissions. A CO2 calculator can assist companies with this time-consuming job. What is the new generation of TMS? Full visibility has been a long-time dream. Freight companies were looking for real-time tracking for many years and saw solutions implemented as Amazon clients began tracking their shipments. Uberization brought the idea to shippers that they could shop for transport through mobile applications on smartphones. These applications can handle so-called “ easy-freight ” - for example, specific spot-market last-mile delivery. Short-term spot-market transactions have become 15
