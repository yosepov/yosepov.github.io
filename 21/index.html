 peak holiday shopping season, logistics optimization needs to be precise, efficient and flexible and blockchain offers the necessary innovation. Another field that cargo companies are developing is reverse logistics. This refers to a situation in which a customer may use the last mile as a beginning point for the next shipment. For example, when a truck comes into the port terminal to unload cargo for storage, other goods must be ready and waiting for loading to start the next shipment. Companies are looking to improve reverse logistics, such as identifying damage-free products that could be simply repacked and shipped, avoiding the need to restock items. What is the last mile solution I think is the best? New emerging technologies can offer original solutions for optimization. All of our ideas bring us to the main point which is to create a one-stop shop platform to manage the supply chain ecosystem. This is something like a flowchart, where there is connectivity between the many possible transport steps: ship, airport, train, truck, and all the way to the people who load and unload the trucks; finally connecting the distribution to the client. Full digitization connects all the cargo documentation including tax information according to the law of each country. The ecosystem involves every little detail: what is the most efficient way to deliver cargo. Each truck arrives at the warehouse where the system automatically calculates the conditions and prepares the cargo for distribution. Efficient cargo delivery requires connectivity with timetables, cargo storage, traffic conditions, fleet emissions information, and more. When more and more users are connected to an online platform, the sharing economy model can promote efficiency and cut costs. For example, route optimization matches can be found between different transport and logistics companies, allowing empty trucks to be reduced from the roads. A one-stop shop online platform for fleet managers is a great solution as all the data is available in one place. This state-of-the-art system is being developed through programming from artificial intelligence (AI), Business Intelligence (BI) and machine learning providing us with future journeys that will be extremely efficient. Let ’ s be part of the ecosystem! 21
