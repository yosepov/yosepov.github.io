Another field that cargo companies are developing is reverse logistics. This refers to a situation in which a customer may use the last mile as a beginning point for the next shipment. For example, when a truck comes into the port terminal to unload cargo for storage, other goods must be ready and waiting for loading to start the next shipment. Companies are looking to improve reverse logistics, such as identifying damage-free products that could be simply repacked and shipped, avoiding the need to restock items. What is the last mile solution I think is the best? New emerging technologies can offer original solutions for optimization. All of our ideas bring us to the main point which is to create a one-stop shop platform to manage the supply chain ecosystem. This is something like a flowchart, where there is connectivity between the many possible transport steps: ship, airport, train, truck, and all the way to the people who load and unload the trucks; finally connecting the distribution to the client. Full digitization connects all the cargo documentation including tax information according to the law of each country. The ecosystem involves every little detail: what is the most efficient way to deliver cargo. Each truck arrives at the warehouse where the system automatically calculates the conditions and prepares the cargo for distribution. Efficient cargo delivery requires connectivity with timetables, cargo storage, traffic conditions, fleet emissions information, and more. When more and more users are connected to an online platform, the sharing economy model can promote efficiency and cut costs. For example, route optimization matches can be found between different transport and logistics companies, allowing empty trucks to be reduced from the roads. A one-stop shop online platform for fleet managers is a great solution as all the data is available in one place. This state-of-the-art system is being developed through programming from artificial intelligence (AI), Business Intelligence (BI) and machine learning providing us with future journeys that will be extremely efficient.

It also assists in directing the utilization of available resources by providing real-time inventory to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse. As mentioned a WMS offers support to staff in the performance of material movement and storage in and around a warehouse. To ensure efficient logistics and supply chain management, a WMS is often integrated with other related systems, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), transportation management systems (TMS) and inventory management systems. This integration with cargo management systems can open up a new way of improving transport in the supply chain. When a truck comes into the warehouse to collect cargo, an automated truck loading system will be ready, therefore the truck will not need to waste time waiting in a line. It works the same in both directions - a loaded truck arriving at the warehouse with cargo will have a robot waiting that prepares the area for delivery. Much time and resources can be saved. In the near future, when autonomous trucks are expected to be on the road for transporting goods, they will be able to connect directly with the automated warehouse. The modern world shows us that automation opens up great opportunities for logistics businesses, and robotics can assist in tackling current and future challenges of logistics management. With reduced labor costs, fewer accidents and increased safety - as well as 24/7 service - we will be able to significantly increase efficiency. 13 “I do not fear computers.

We are in an era in which companies have the opportunity to reinvent their organization and their business model. They have the chance to not only automate the existing infrastructure, but they can also build new operating platforms adapted to robotic machines. Nevertheless, automation and robotization should have limits. To be the most effective, automated machines should work side-by-side and in harmony with people.

In a supply chain, cargo or parcels can be delivered to a central hub through various modes of transport, such as planes, ships, trains and trucks. The typical final destination of a product’s journey is to a private residence or storage in a large cargo warehouse. This issue of the“last mile” has become a high priority for companies mainly because of the high costs involved in moving goods. Although, this final step is called “the last mile”, its actual distance can range from a few blocks to hundreds of kilometers. What solutions have delivery companies already created? Big shipping companies such as DHL, UPS, FedEx have to deal, as well, with the issue of unattended parcels. Amazon found a solution and launched its own delivery channels for improved last-mile service to the customer’s door. If no one is home to receive a package they offer a few options including the use of pick-up locations. They aim to earn clients’ trust, reduce delays and save money for the company. In the past few years, Amazon introduced a system of small drones in big cities that provides fast delivery within 30 minutes for parcels (within a 20km radius) weighing up to 2.3 kg. A challenge for large delivery companies and their expanded networks is how to focus on and optimize the last-mile route, for reducing logistics costs and improving efficiency. TMS (Transport Management System) software is used to create better routes and can identify additional risk, cargo emissions, traffic conditions, fuel costs and even labor costs.

We must begin to regard the economic co-benefits of lowering carbon emissions and company profit. Our goal is to put a company’s profit along the same line with environmental needs. The logistics industry faces a challenge however, at the same time, also an excellent opportunity. The business strategy of a company must be focused not only on finding lowcost solutions when it chooses the supplier for its services. In the world today, we notice a lot of leading companies choosing environmentally sound solutions, such as reducing deadhead mileage. Then, we moved to the idea of BI (Business Intelligence), a technologydriven process for analyzing data from a company’s activities. Better information is provided that helps executives, managers and other corporate end-users make informed business decisions. Remember the fleet manager? His work is inefficient because nobody provided him with the tools he needs. For the manager of the fleet there is technology chaos on the table: TMS, Telematics, GPS and systems for route optimization. They are not connected. To avoid jumping from system to system requires a one-stop shop. One of the tools the fleet manager needs for a one-stop shop solution is an emission calculations device including an online dashboard. The system supposed should be connected to all available data in order to calculate automatically optimized routes according to traffic, road situation, distance in a lifetime for the entire run. The search will bring a better solution for the smartest way for providing cargo delivery. The system will support the fleet manager and become his best partner of the day. This is the time to change the culture of the industry of transportation and logistics and to recognize the importance of more sustainable behavior. Technology can help us find a better way to transport goods by improving fleet operations and lowering carbon footprints.

Smaller chances of mistakes will also lead to a noticeable improvement in the transmission of information within the warehouse. In addition, with robots involved in warehouse management working hours of the warehouse can be extended to 24/7, resulting in much more cargo loading and deliveries. What are the negative sides of using automated systems in the warehouse? By bringing in robots to the workplace we often remove people from their jobs. Workers can be replaced when technology develops and improves, especially when machines can take on more complicated and difficult tasks. Purchasing equipment for work in the warehouse demands that a company consider the long-term benefits, due to the high investment price for automation. Although labor costs may be reduced (fewer insurance payments and employee benefits), the warehouse still needs to pay for maintenance and programming. We must keep in mind that robots are limited in terms of their flexibility and as opposed to humans they are not able to analyze and apply critical thinking. Humans can still outperform the machine in many respects. In addition, robots are not able to respond appropriately to changing circumstances or unpredictable situations. - Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) The big game-changer for warehouse automation was the development of the Warehouse Management System, a cost-effective method to achieve improved efficiency and more accurate inventory.

Strategic planning using BI leads to improving and optimizing the performance of operations. The port environment is strategic for national security and modern ports are often multimodal distribution hubs providing transport links using sea, road, rail and air routes. Port management plays a major role in the interface between sea, air, rail and land for handling the loading and moving of freight from the moment of arrival at a terminal. One small error can lead to unnecessary costs, delays of delivery and inefficiency. Effective terminal management provides port security, knowledge of regulations, links with supply chains, and more.

There is a challenge around the specific type of engine and the availability of fueling stations for trucks using shale gas, which will require additional technology and infrastructure investments. CNG can be used in diesel engines with better fuel consumption. Regarding sustainability, it is still a fossil fuel and its production leaves a huge carbon footprint. Energy storage for electric vehicles in the cargo industry is still a big challenge with regard to safety, size, cost and overall management of the battery. The cost of truck downtime during charging may make it less appealing in some supply chains. Besides, after full charging, a truck can run on average for about 350 kilometers, while most long shipments are 1000 kilometers or more. We should keep in mind that the local electricity network gets its power from plants that are not necessarily emission free, so it can be difficult to measure actual emissions from alternative vehicles. For example, in Iceland almost all electricity production is provided by renewable energy, therefore vehicle charging stations are powered by the grid that generates electricity from hydropower and geothermal power. On the other hand, in the United States, most of the electricity generated is from fossil fuels. The production of alternative fuels grows every year, nevertheless, many challenges remain. Even if we solve the problem of lack of resources, there are still several open environmental issues. Based on the pace of hybrid vehicle development in the world, it seems to be the most promising idea for the next generation of trucks. This next period will be a middle step in the move towards electricity as the main fuel source. The EU, the USA and Japan already are improving efficiency through engine downsizing. Low Emissions Zones (LEZ) are becoming more popular in cities throughout the developed world. This is a defined area where access is restricted to improve air quality. Polluting trucks are not allowed to enter, therefore this is an additional incentive for logistics companies to use more dual-fuel engines to ensure that regular cargo deliveries will not be interrupted. After we see hybrid trucks on the market we will be able to think about how to make the full electric system more efficient. The solution is to find a way of charging the battery during the trip, using already existing technologies such as solar panels or wireless roads that charge the vehicle while driving. Our goal for the moment is to create optimization by using a variety of digital technologies to manage efficiently heavy duty vehicle fleets. 24","@ID":24},{"#text":"https://trucknet.io/en/","@ID":46},{"#text":"The total time a truck spends in the terminal area is called turnaround time. It includes the time from the arrival, loading, and unloading of containers, inspection of the truck, filling out the documentation, and going out from the terminal. Extended truck turnaround time can cause an increase in port congestion that slows down the movement of cargo out of the terminal. The longer the turnaround time, the chance that a port may run out of storage facilities will increase. In addition, if a truck does not exit the port quickly, it blocks new trucks from going in, which reduces efficiency and increases the expense of port operations. Demurrage and detention (fees that companies must pay for using containers after they have gone over the allotted time for usage) bring significant costs for cargo companies. In September 2020, the EU issued a Call for Proposals for research and innovation projects relating to the European Green Deal, its major initiative for achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The Call is looking for concrete and effective solutions to respond to the current environmental emergencies. There are ten areas in which projects will be funded, including sustainable and smart mobility. There are two available topics in this area of the Call: green airports and ports as multimodal hubs for sustainable and smart mobility. What are the main problems in port transportation? The air cargo industry is still largely paper-based. Many types of documents are required for shipments beginning with the shipper all the way to the final terminal. Much of this is prepared with copies of very large amounts of paper. With the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry confronted the huge impact of increasing the demand for air cargo. Imagine the thousands of copies of documents that have to be physically touched by many during the Pandemic. In some cases, the air cargo paper documentation is shipped separately from the actual cargo via express couriers. Validation of data in this situation requires human input, often resulting in the need of gathering hundreds of employees. It should be noted that the European Union (EU) prepared a roadmap, the “Green Deal”, for making their economy sustainable, competitive and carbon neutral by 2050. This growth strategy is in line with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement. More than 50% of goods are transported by road and today transport accounts for 25% of GHG emissions in Europe.

For those companies trying to create an online freight marketplace, a BID system (bidding price, like an auction) would offer the client the opportunity to compare and find the best match for the price. This type of coordination using live updates and documentation can greatly improve freight management. Digitalization is a big game-changer for the new generation of TMS. With preinstalled features for all cargo documentation, the tax process can proceed faster and smoother. This saves much time and delay; for example, at a port when a truck is forced to wait for hours before moving on. Today cargo companies prefer to have trucks with built-in Telematics in their fleets. Manufacturers have made a new business model in which they not only provide the device, they also provide the service, which contributes to a more profitable business. Machine learning can be applied to predict the need for vehicle maintenance. Methods for predictive maintenance combine on-board data and off-board database sources, which analyze the data for deviations (based on vehicle usage statistics and maintenance records). Business Intelligence (BI) resources make it possible to create value from big data. Some examples of these technologies include dashboards, data warehouses, data analysis through graphs and more. For example, BI tools can improve logistics management by providing a view of the entire supply chain, and offer an analysis of where delays are most likely to occur. The biggest challenge today for TMS is visibility. The system streamlines the entire supply chain process, with automated communication between suppliers, customers, and service providers.

Level 5 will be implemented in the future when a vehicle is able to handle all driving tasks. Test runs of autonomous trucks are already being carried out today. The trucks can be programmed to travel from point A to point B without drivers, under limited conditions. However, human drivers still are in the trucks for safety reasons and can take over the car controls (steering wheel and floor pedals) in case of emergency. What are the benefits that autonomous truck tech brings us? In everyday life more and more cargo companies are needed to deliver goods. Autonomous trucks will bring greater efficiency to the trucking market. With the same number of drivers or even fewer, self-driving car technology allows for moving more freight. Today the self-driving car system is more suitable for the highway as long as for the first and the last mile, human drivers are in charge. Labor regulations for professional truckers are different in each country. When taking into consideration 10 hours of work followed by 8 hours of rest, the labor costs for a company can be high while some companies may put 2 drivers on the road for a non-stop run. The self-driving car technology system can make deliveries 24/7 and avoid the busiest traffic time by going out at night instead of early morning. Working on the highway is difficult, stressful, including long hours without sleep. However, it is much simpler than driving in city streets, where one has to deal with pedestrians, complex traffic, pets on the road and other factors that make autonomous driving technology hard to analyze and navigate. Autonomous driving technology brings big benefits to safety. Every year, trucks are involved in hundreds of thousands of collisions, resulting in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries. Out of 100 fatal accidents on the road, an average of 35 are caused by heavy vehicles. Traveling during off-peak hours helps to reduce accidents during the busiest time of the day. Besides, the autonomous truck doesn’t need to take a break and rest like a human driver, avoiding the human factors that cause accidents. Reducing costs is another advantage of self-driving systems. For example, fuel costs are a huge part of the overall maintenance of cargo companies, and the customer pays a high price, depending on these costs. A trucker drives with emotion and every time he pushes on the gas and brake pedals, this consumes extra fuel. The autonomous system automatically chooses the optimal route to take. Trucks that are equipped with features for vehicle platooning -the linking of two or more trucks in convoy, using connectivity technology and automated driving support systems - will be able to decrease fuel consumption and reduce CO2 emissions. Platooning allows heavy vehicles to travel closely and safely together following a lead vehicle that controls speed and direction through wireless communication, - a kind of mechanical coupling, similar to \"road trains''. 18","@ID":18},{"#text":"The transportation and logistics industry in the days of COVID-19 18 Jun 2020 The world has changed.

Otto is concerned about the number of highway fatalities. The need to make the truck safer is one of the company’s goals since 70% of freight in the US is delivered by trucks. Pony.ai is best known for applying a self-driving system in the passenger car but recently realized that the technology for trucks will be implemented much earlier because of the tremendous interest, already seen today, and support in commercializing autonomous trucks. Our next step will be to find the solution so we can connect the transport management system (TMS) to the autonomous truck system such that it will be responsible all the way, respond to every change on the road route and bring the client full visibility. Remember the song of John Lennon “Imagine”: “you may say I’m a dreamer But I’m not the only one I hope someday you will join us And the world will live as one” Maybe now all this seems far in the future, but don’t forget just in the 1950s we gave up the idea of using elevator operators! 19","@ID":19},{"#text":"Hysteria is history Carbon Emissions DATA Regulation DATA Traffic DATA Telematics Market Place DATA CrossCompany Sharing DATA ROAD DATA 38","@ID":38},{"#text":"The people behind 44","@ID":44},{"#text":"33 What will be our next move to reach the middle of the recovery path? The critical time showed us the inefficiency of using only manpower in the field. We used to live in a world in which we took stock every quarter/year period. Now the situation around us changes daily, therefore stocktaking must happen instantly. We are beginning to think out of the box to create new income in exchange for what we lost during the pandemic. The key to an optimized environment is utilizing resources to their full capacity. The transportation market is constrained by truck capacity, miles traveled per day and hours of service available to a driver. With open digital freight networks we optimize the demand with the available supply of shipping capacity, thereby enhancing efficiency. At this moment a network, not in one country alone but rather in several countries, must be connected to have more economical value. We create an ecosystem of shippers, carriers, drivers to avoid the model in which every company, and even a single representative of the cargo chain, works separately. In practice, this means customers always have an overview of their freight, they can check its status and, in case of doubt, can change transport routes or modes, while being informed of any financial impact. The technology of TMS, E-POD, ELD integration helps to achieve the automated process. Creativity is contagious, pass it on A.

The interaction between companies and customers has been radically transformed. Regarding the logistics sector, the challenge for these companies is to rethink the entire supply chain process. Technology plays a key role here for meeting the needs of customers and offering high-quality service. Optimization The ability to integrate large amounts of fully automated data in the logistics chain was a huge step within the industry that led to a Digitization across the supply chain assists companies in significantly reducing operating costs and improving administrative processes. In the context of digital transformation, new business models can be considered and reviewed. Technological systems have revolutionized the logistics industry, an invaluable contribution in terms of process optimization. Measures such as geolocation (real-time vehicle locating system), planning, paperless trade, and the provision of high-value datasets all ensure improved decision-making options for management. Big Data Big data challenges include storage and analyzing so much information as well as developing real-time analytic capacity and expertise. Data integration and validation (data governance) is a serious concern for companies as is security. In the world of logistics these challenges can be found in vehicle diagnostics, driving patterns, location information, traffic and weather data from sensors, forecast systems, operational systems and more.

The interest in developing autonomous vehicle technology extends beyond passenger cars. Some companies that manufacture cargo vehicles such as GM and Ford also are taking a closer look at the importance and potential for driverless semi-trucks (a combination of a tractor unit and one, or more, semi-trailers to carry freight). Trucking industries aim to increase their efficiency and move more cargo between destinations with less expense. The international standard (J3016) of the Society of Automotive 17 Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation. Level 0 represents no automation, in which the driver is in full control and Level 5 represents full automation in which the driver only needs to start the car while the car does the rest. Today we are at Level 3, that involves conditional assistance in which the driver has access to automatic devices that steer, brake, accelerate and shift gears for the vehicle. However, the driver must be ready at all times to take over if necessary. Typically, these features are used on the open highway under good driving conditions, with the driver resuming control when leaving the freeway.","@ID":17},{"#text":"Recent research shows that big data is the new frontier for innovation and productivity, with transparent information and utilizable at much higher levels. Companies will more and more need to access and integrate huge amounts of information from multiple data sources. Big Data analytics in the logistics industry can be used to optimize routing, for example, with major operational improvements possible regarding last-mile deliveries. This specific challenge in last-mile logistics can be tricky. It is often the most expensive component for shipping companies that have to navigate in urban areas, with traffic congestion and limited space, in order to reach a destination on time. Shippers expect transparency and supply chain visibility is critical. If a shipment is late, carriers want to know about it as soon as possible to prevent serious complications in the supply chain. On the other hand, efficient deliveries carried out on time will be a merit for the carrier while the shipper will feel confident and customer satisfaction will increase. As mentioned, route optimization depends on quick data analysis, while keeping in mind that weather conditions could change, highway and roads could close, and the number of vehicles on the roads could increase, thereby changing the scheduled time frame. Based on the pace of hybrid vehicle development in the world, it seems to be the most promising idea for the next generation of trucks. This next period will be a middle step in the move towards electricity as the main fuel source. The EU, the USA and Japan already are improving efficiency through engine downsizing. Low Emissions Zones (LEZ) are becoming more popular in cities throughout the developed world. This is a defined area where access is restricted to improve air quality. Polluting trucks are not allowed to enter, therefore this is an additional incentive for logistics companies to use more dual-fuel engines to ensure that regular cargo deliveries will not be interrupted. After we see hybrid trucks on the market we will be able to think about how to make the full electric system more efficient. The solution is to find a way of charging the battery during the trip, using already existing technologies such as solar panels or wireless roads that charge the vehicle while driving. Our goal for the moment is to create optimization by using a variety of digital technologies to manage efficiently heavy duty vehicle fleets costs and has led to a reduction of thousands of tons of CO2 emissions.. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Business Intelligence (BI) AI provides the power to analyze huge amounts of data, allowing logistics companies to utilize data daily. One of the key goals of the logistics industry is to automate timeconsuming activities, to increase efficiency and reduce transportation costs. AI provides a set of algorithms that offers complex outputs and decisions based upon incoming data. The combination of the fields will give us, among other things, the business intelligence (BI) that uses techniques such as data mining in order to improve business processes. Machine Learning – the computer’s ability to learn and draw conclusions based on a database and we enjoy automatic service (A-Z) at the click of a button. Big data has changed warehouse operations considerably. By applying computer vision taking inventory has become automatic and of course much more productive. In the case of the autonomous vehicle, it still will take some time before we find such a mode of transportation on roads, without human supervision. Hanan Friedman Founder and President However, autonomous vehicles are already used to transport goods within warehouse areas, airports and harbors. The fast-changing world of technology brings us a new way of life. It has changed our way of thinking.

A key lever in strategies for achieving the Paris Agreement targets is moving from fossil fuel use to renewable energies, including nuclear power, and advancing towards less energy-intensive economies. Needless to say, the transport sector generates a large share of GHG emissions. Both shippers and carriers have much to consider as they aim to diversify their mix of energy sources for transportation. It’s a balancing act that requires weighing many factors such as capital investment, cost of energy consumption, available infrastructure, and individual sustainability goals. We divide internal combustion engines into two categories: single fuel source (the most common) and multi-fuel source. Here we use battery-electric vehicles, solar, biofuel (biodiesel, bio alcohol, ethanol, charcoal, compressed natural gas etc.). Dual fuel vehicles use two types of complete fuel systems and can operate on either of the fuels (for example gas + liquid, gas + gas, liquid + liquid). Flexible fuel, known as flex-fuel/flexifuel in Europe or flex in Brazil, is used in vehicles with an internal combustion engine designed to run on more than one type of fuel. The most common flexible fuel vehicles on the market use a blend of gasoline and up to 83% ethanol. What is the real answer to alternative fuel? We can talk about 3 categories of alternatives to fossil fuels for transportation: biofuels, e-fuels, solar fuels. These low carbon fuels greatly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Biofuels, produced from biomass, are already available. Examples include ethanol made from sugar cane, corn, sorghum and biodiesel made from vegetable oils and liquid animal fats. These fuels are in a class of renewable energy, less toxic and much more sustainable than conventional fossil fuels, and can reduce emissions in the transport sector. Of course, there are challenges, such as the difficulty in using biodiesel in cold climates since it causes crystallization and the fuel tends to gel (freeze) which could cause severe damage to a truck’s engine. As mentioned above, compressed and liquefied natural gas (CNG and LNG) are alternatives to petrol and diesel. CNG was actually in use before the Second World War in Europe, however, the problems of reduced storage space made travel distance very short - 5070 kilometers. Today, this more sustainable lower-emissions alternative is gaining market share for heavy-duty transportation. Advancements in engine and fuel system technologies have contributed to the logistics industry’s use together with its low and stable stock price. LNG is more expensive than CNG to produce, store and transport. It emits slightly higher levels of GHG emissions. Its use is more common in Europe where there is a lack of pipelines for long distance CNG transport. 23","@ID":23},{"#text":"What are the main functions of TMS? No matter what the size of a logistics company, we find that its main task is to increase efficiency and profitability for clients. The main function of a TMS Is to manage route schedules and delivery operations. The importance of telematics in transport systems cannot be overlooked. Efficient transportation management and licensing result in reduced vehicle wear and tear and increased vehicle uptime (ensuring the vehicle is always ready to perform). Analyzing engine status and driving behavior can reduce fuel costs by 10% on average, often equating to a payback of millions. Freight transport operations are a major source of CO2 emissions, while efficient management and performance can reduce the carbon footprint and promote more sustainable logistics activities. It should be noted that a TMS does not analyze the data that is conveyed to the fleet manager. What are the telematics information resources? For transport fleets operating in competitive markets, even the smallest amount of time and resources become critical issues in determining success. It’s here that a vehicle tracking device alone is not enough. The telematics system uses a few sources of information. Actively managing your fleet’s fuel consumption can save you money, increase productivity, and even improve safety. One way to reduce the amount of fuel used is by improving poor driving behavior. It has been proven time and again that fuel is consumed unnecessarily when drivers speed, idle their vehicles, brake and/or accelerate harshly. These behaviors not only waste fuel but may also cause excess vehicle wear and tear, which leads to the need for more frequent fleet maintenance. Studies show that a fleet management tracking device does an excellent job of monitoring the location and activities of a vehicle. Also, reports published on fleet management software show that it provides the best means to mitigate risks, such as dangerous driving behavior, and to identify who may need professional driver training. A carbon footprint calculator allows us to measure a truck’s CO2 emissions. Certain heavy vehicle fleets are already required to calculate and report GHG emissions. A CO2 calculator can assist companies with this time-consuming job. What is the new generation of TMS? Full visibility has been a long-time dream. Freight companies were looking for real-time tracking for many years and saw solutions implemented as Amazon clients began tracking their shipments. Uberization brought the idea to shippers that they could shop for transport through mobile applications on smartphones. These applications can handle so-called “easy-freight” - for example, specific spot-market last-mile delivery.

However, a truly eco-friendly vehicle needs to meet specific requirements and can include electric cars, hybrid-electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and more. These vehicles are powered by alternatives to fossil fuels (gasoline, natural gas, diesel) and do not produce tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Why do we need alternative transportation fuel? A combination of several factors affects how we address the need for alternative fuels. There is environmental and ecological awareness, concerns about high oil prices and uncertainty regarding the time when world oil production will peak, all influencing the priorities set by governments and vehicle manufacturers for developing cleaner fuel sources and power systems for vehicles.
