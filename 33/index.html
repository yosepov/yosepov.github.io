 33 What will be our next move to reach the middle of the recovery path? The critical time showed us the inefficiency of using only manpower in the field. We used to live in a world in which we took stock every quarter/year period. Now the situation around us changes daily, therefore stocktaking must happen instantly. We are beginning to think out of the box to create new income in exchange for what we lost during the pandemic. The key to an optimized environment is utilizing resources to their full capacity. The transportation market is constrained by truck capacity, miles traveled per day and hours of service available to a driver. With open digital freight networks we optimize the demand with the available supply of shipping capacity, thereby enhancing efficiency. At this moment a network, not in one country alone but rather in several countries, must be connected to have more economical value. We create an ecosystem of shippers, carriers, drivers to avoid the model in which every company, and even a single representative of the cargo chain, works separately. In practice, this means customers always have an overview of their freight, they can check its status and, in case of doubt, can change transport routes or modes, while being informed of any financial impact. The technology of TMS, E-POD, ELD integration helps to achieve the automated process. Creativity is contagious, pass it on A. Einstein This is particularly relevant in a crisis, where priorities of companies and societies can change rapidly. The recent crisis especially taught us that we must work together to succeed – and digitally. And the optimal solution is technology, technology, technology. “ “
