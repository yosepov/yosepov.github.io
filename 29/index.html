 Every day a company has significant amounts of cargo and each load requires a set of papers. If someone makes a mistake, documents need to be changed and printed again. Even if the company tries to use technology for improvement such as TMS and/or GPS, they still use paper. At the end of the day, the only thing the fleet manager strives for is the financial aspect of the company and its benefits. Environmental concern is not taken into consideration. In this case, transportation suppliers must find a solution and balance between financial profitability and environmental protection. Outcomes from UNFCCC Many places in the world are still working with fax machines and printed paper, though technological developments already allow us to be much more resourceful The Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a global response to the unquestionable threat of climate change. Its long- term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2&#176;C (above pre-industrial levels) and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5&#176;C. The historic Agreement was approved at the UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in 2015 and entered into force in November 2016. The Agreement commits all countries, developed and developing, to prepare national action plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. Governments are required to transparently report their progress. 29
