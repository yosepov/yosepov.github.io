 32 The main challenges cargo industries faced during the pandemic were connected with delayed deliveries and the damage and loss of cargo in the perishable goods industry. Furthermore, the freight market still involves an array of people involved in preparations starting with loading, through to packaging and documentation. Despite the widespread introduction of digital technology and the use of modern communication systems, documentation procedures are a crucial part of the process. Forwarders, carriers, customs authorities and even banks – all deal with paperwork, performed by people. How have we adapted to our ordinary life? During the lockdown, suddenly we realized almost everything can be done digitally. You don ’ t need to go to the office – the office comes to you with Slack and Zoom meetings with your colleagues. If before, we could have only 4 meetings per day, now we can have at least 6. Online grocery shopping shows us how much time we can save without standing in line or waiting in traffic, especially after work hours. Studying from your home wasn ’ t invented by Corona, as we had Coursera and Open University before. What about sport? It moved into our living rooms with yoga apps and YouTube home gym devices. The widespread use of the internet has brought us to the sharing economy. It got our attention from the beginning with the ideas from AirBnB and Amazon.
