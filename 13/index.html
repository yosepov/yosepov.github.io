 This system facilitates warehouse management in daily planning, organizing, staffing, and more. It also assists in directing the utilization of available resources by providing real-time inventory to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse. As mentioned a WMS offers support to staff in the performance of material movement and storage in and around a warehouse. To ensure efficient logistics and supply chain management, a WMS is often integrated with other related systems, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), transportation management systems (TMS) and inventory management systems. This integration with cargo management systems can open up a new way of improving transport in the supply chain. When a truck comes into the warehouse to collect cargo, an automated truck loading system will be ready, therefore the truck will not need to waste time waiting in a line. It works the same in both directions - a loaded truck arriving at the warehouse with cargo will have a robot waiting that prepares the area for delivery. Much time and resources can be saved. In the near future, when autonomous trucks are expected to be on the road for transporting goods, they will be able to connect directly with the automated warehouse. The modern world shows us that automation opens up great opportunities for logistics businesses, and robotics can assist in tackling current and future challenges of logistics management. With reduced labor costs, fewer accidents and increased safety - as well as 24/7 service - we will be able to significantly increase efficiency. 13 “ I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them. ” Isaac Asimov 1920-1992 Robots are autonomous machines that can offer effective solutions for productivity and security. We are in an era in which companies have the opportunity to reinvent their organization and their business model. They have the chance to not only automate the existing infrastructure, but they can also build new operating platforms adapted to robotic machines. Nevertheless, automation and robotization should have limits. To be the most effective, automated machines should work side-by-side and in harmony with people. Isaac Asimov, creator of the three laws of robotics, 1942 (rules from his science fiction short story “ Runaround ” ); the author of “ I, Robot ” , 1950
