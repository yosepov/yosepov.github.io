 Sustainable behavior in the logistics and transportati on industry 12 Jul 2020 How does the market work today? Today, more than 20% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from the transportation and logistics industry. If you look at the official statistics of the OECD for North America ’ s commercial vehicle fleets, you will find that about 36% of trucks are empty in the USA. At the same time, approximately 27% of trucks run empty in Europe and 40% in Asia. The demand in the logistics world increases each year along with economic growth, strengthening the need for supply chain collaboration. Sustainability in the logistics sector means lowering the carbon footprints. This goal includes reducing CO2 emissions, as well as noise pollution and accidents. Imagine the fleet manager ’ s day. He used to be a driver himself, now he manages the operation of the company ’ s trucks. During his shift, he may have a few problems to solve which are all connected with costs: per hour payment for drivers, fuel consumption, truck maintenance, etc. The company doesn ’ t have time to deal with optimization and empty miles. Simply put, because this process is not automatic. Hanan Friedman Trucknet Founder &amp; President 28
