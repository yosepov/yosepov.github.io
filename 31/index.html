        <h1>TRUCKNET - DIGITAL MAGAZINE  - December 2020</h1>
        <div>
 The transportation and logistics industry in the days of COVID-19 18 Jun 2020 T he world has changed. The income and profit of the world economy have dropped. Today we cannot talk about the modern world as if during the past few months nothing has happened. The changes have affected not only markets, schools ,relationships in overall performance, but our ideology has been hit, leaving us to experience this new reality. We used to live in a world without boundaries, and this world no longer exists. The new order that has taken over, with new boundaries, is causing us to think in a totally different manner. Hanan Friedman Trucknet Founder &amp; President 31 Non-revenue generating miles or empty miles equal unnecessary movement. The impact from wastes of empty miles increases costs for shippers and carriers. But there are more consequences, beyond costs, in terms of damage caused to our environment. In our everyday world trucks must return to their home shipyard with or without a return load. Nowadays, suppliers attempt to increase return loads since this boosts the revenue generated by the asset and reduces the truck ’ s carbon footprint. The main challenges cargo industries faced during the pandemic were connected with delayed deliveries and the damage and loss of cargo in the perishable goods industry. Furthermore, the freight market still involves an array of people involved in preparations starting with loading, through to packaging and documentation. What problems did cargo industries face? The majority of difficulties in the industry existed before, but during the pandemic the bubble exploded when it came across a new reality.
