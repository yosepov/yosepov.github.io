 It should be noted that transport is a significant part of both topic areas when planning and establishing sustainable and green airports and/or ports. What are the possible solutions? Since the cargo industry is still wrestling with the issue of paper documentation the solution will need to be full digitalization of the workplace, in which all stakeholders are connected in one ecosystem. 7 The diverse main players across the board come from various regions of the world, with different regulations; therefore an online digital platform is essential. Launching one ecosystem would not only unlock the dependence on paper documentation for the cargo industry, it would also offer a platform for matching cargo. In other words, a truck would have the option of combining a few deliveries rather than taking one shipment only. This optimization method would bring all the relevant players in the cargo supply chain together in one system. The Port of Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe, is an excellent example of an efficient logistics hub where smart technology is being implemented. Their digital platform assists in finding the best options for shipping routes, including all transport modes, via Rotterdam with minimal CO2 emissions. Trucknet ’ s cloud-based platform aims to optimize freight routes and the company intends to advance to including multi-modal solutions through the implementation of smart technologies. Additional suggestions for measures in line with Green Deal policy for contributing to green airport/port planning would include operating E-trucks, fuel optimization, alternative fuel for trucks and aircraft, sustainable waste disposal, and even supplying meals with a lower carbon footprint; this would be in addition to the effective integration of transport modes within and around the airport/port.
